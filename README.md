### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Ryan Shipley, I am a full stack developer who loves to implement my knowledge to solve a wide range of problems. I love to spread my knowledege to as many people as possible.

Being the Star Wars fan that I am, I plan on making a larger API with more information to make a better application.
